| scholar | plugin (generated) | Yes | CLEAN |
| himalaya-mcp | plugin (generated) | Yes | CLEAN |

🎯 Next Action:
→ Replace scribe-cli placeholder SHA when v0.3.0 release is created
→ Verify update-formula workflow uses App token correctly (next time a project releases)
→ Monitor: push-trigger suppression may need further investigation (PR #94 fix didn't fully resolve)
